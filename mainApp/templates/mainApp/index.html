                The Sketchpass is a password manager that allows you to store, organize, and generate complex passwords for any of your favorite websites. The pain of misplacing or forgetting passwords is left behind when you can securely access them through your own unique sketch-based password that is drawn on a grid with a variety of color options for added security. A personalized image drawn by you is much easier to remember and harder to crack than any combination of characters. Give us a try and register today!
